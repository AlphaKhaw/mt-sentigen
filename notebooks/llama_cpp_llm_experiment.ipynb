      "If I could give this office zero stars, I would. A year ago, we visited the office hoping to get some assistance in planning an itinerary that would involve air and train travel. The person in the AAA office who specialized in this knew nothing at all about Amtrack and could only offer us the web address. Flashforward to this year. We stopped in the office to request a TripTik for a planned drive from Orange, MA to Wildwood, NJ. We were told the one person in the office capable of mapping out the route was off that day, but the receptionist took our information and said the responsible party would call us the following morning. We left instructions for the trip an area of Connecticut we wanted to avoid because we knew of major construction and that we wanted to cross the Hudson via the Tappanzee Bridge rather than the George Washington. We had visited the office on a Wednesday. When we hadnt heard from AAA by Monday morning, we called the office and spoke with the person who is responsible for creating TripTiks. She found the receptionists note, but hadnt begun working on it yet. I explained we were leaving very early Wednesday morning, so I needed to pick up the information Tuesday. She assured me all would be ready. I asked if she would also provide a travel book for New Jersey and paper maps for all the states wed be going through and she agreed all would be together for us when we arrived at the office. My husband went to the office in the middle of Tuesday afternoon. The TripTik wasnt bound yet, so he had to wait for that to be done. When he asked about the maps and tour book, the woman pointed toward a wall and said, Theyre over there. The TripTik amounted to nothing more than segments of maps that could have been printed from Mapquest. Once upon a time, such a routing document from AAA would include information about restaurants, etc., on each segment of the trip, but apparently thats no longer the case. This document along with the staff of this office proved to be utterly USELESS. If I didnt need the roadside services, Id drop my membership.\n",

      "This establishment has been there for 20 years yet the actual bar is dated from 1910. The food here was very well prepared. I ordered trout because it is the easiest dish to make and the hardest dish to make to do it well. It was a great dish. The mixologists were extraordinary. Their knowledge of all things libation wise was very impressive. I met only one equal bartender which was Chris at Catherine Lombardi in New Brunswick. Dirty martinis are easy to make. Try asking for a mai tai. The best bartenders know how to raise this cocktail to a high level. I think that Jordy from Verve and Chris formerly from Catherine Lombardi should have a throwdown.\n",
